this exists for the simple purpose of showing people when they ask me "how do i do this shit?"

## Steps to get it working

1. i hope you know how to run .php files
    - or get fucked lol
2. see that file called `db.sql` ?
    1. it contains all the table sql required to run this without errors
    2. open up phpmyadmin or whatever you use to run sql
    3. make sure you are executing the sql in the 'test' database or the database you choose. if you chose an another on ... ya gotta edit `./stuff/config.php`
    4. paste the whole thing in.
    5. execute
3. open up the localhost  
5. the admin user's email and password is...
    - email : `admin@site.com` 
    - password: `nigga123`

## what to do if there is a mysql `password` or `username` or `database not found` error?
1. go to the file `'./stuff/config.php'`
2. change the username or password or the database name
3. profit?
